This is the reporsitory for ML approach for SLM prediction. The original design was aimed for using RNN. But the baseline results is not promising hence it is paused and more energy is shifed towards more promising heat transfer and FDM project.

* Supervised by Brian Giera(LLNL), Sara McMains(UCB)
* Collaborated with Sara Shonkwiller(UCB) and Bodi Yuan(UCB, now GoogleX)
* Data belongs to Lawrence Livermore National Lab(LLNL)
* Details will not be fully revealed to public.

The iPython notebook is a small teaser for the time series ML analysis that I carried out.
